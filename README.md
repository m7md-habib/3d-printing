# 3d-printing
## Overview
This repository contains the STL file of the robotic arm joint. The file has been converted to the STL format suitable for 3D printing.

## File Details
- **File Name:**
- joint.stl
- **Description:**
-  This is the 3D model of the robotic arm joint ready for slicing and 3D printing.

## 3D Printing Setup

### Slicing Software
- **Software Used:** Ankermake Studio
- **Settings:**
  - Material: ABS with Supports enabled
  - Print Mode: High Precision (slower speed for better detail)
  - Print Speed: Reduced for higher accuracy (approx. 40-50 mm/s)
  - Supports: Enabled with grid pattern for overhangs

### Estimated Print Time
- Approximately 1 hour and 18 minutes (may vary depending on printer model and settings)

### Material Choice: ABS
- **Reasons for Choosing ABS:**
  - High strength and durability suitable for mechanical parts
  - Better heat resistance compared to PLA and PETG
  - Suitable for parts that will experience mechanical stress and higher temperatures
- **Printing Considerations:**
  - Requires a heated bed to prevent warping
  - Printing in an enclosed environment is recommended to maintain stable temperature
  - Cooling fan speed should be reduced or turned off to avoid layer cracking
