# 3d-printing
## Overview
This repository contains the STL file of the robotic arm joint was designed before you can find it in my repository in the name of joint. The file has been converted to the STL format suitable for 3D printing.

## File Details
- **File Name:**
- joint.stl
- **Description:**
-  This is the 3D model of the robotic arm joint ready for slicing and 3D printing.

## 3D Printing Setup

### Slicing Software
- **Software Used:** Ankermake Studio
- **Settings:**
  - Material: ABS with Supports enabled
  - Print Mode: High Precision (slower speed for better detail)
  - Print Speed: Reduced for higher accuracy (approx. 40-50 mm/s)
  - Supports: Enabled with grid pattern for overhangs

### Estimated Print Time
- Approximately 1 hour and 18 minutes (may vary depending on printer model and settings)

### Material Choice: ABS
- **Reasons for Choosing ABS:**
  - High strength and durability suitable for mechanical parts
  - Better heat resistance compared to PLA and PETG
  - Suitable for parts that will experience mechanical stress and higher temperatures
- **Printing Considerations:**
  - Requires a heated bed to prevent warping
  - Printing in an enclosed environment is recommended to maintain stable temperature
  - Cooling fan speed should be reduced or turned off to avoid layer cracking
